</p>

<h4>Abstract content and format</h4>

   <OL type="1">
      <LI>The abstract text must be single-spaced and formatted in MSWord or as a Rich Text File with 1-inch margins and fit on a single 8.5 x 11 inch page. All fonts in the abstract must be 11 point Arial. The abstract title must use bold font and “title case.” <a href="MODEL_ABSTRACT_URL" target="_blank">[see Model for the Abstract]</a></LI>
      <LI>Authors are to be listed with non-bold font <a href="MODEL_ABSTRACT_URL" target="_blank">[see Model for the Abstract]</a> including first name, middle initial, last name, and highest degree(s). Each abstract must indicate by underlined font, the name of the person who will present the poster.</LI>
      <LI>For each author, identify institution(s) and location of institution(s) (city, state) as shown in the <a href="MODEL_ABSTRACT_URL" target="_blank">Model for the Abstract</a>.</LI>
      <LI>The abstract text (limited to 2,500 characters including spaces) must include four sections (Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusions; <a href="MODEL_ABSTRACT_URL" target="_blank">[see Model for the Abstract]</a>). The work described may be a completed project or “a work in progress.”</LI>
      <LI>Faculty contact information:  If the poster presenter is not a faculty member, contact information (name, email, phone) for a faculty member, who is either a co-author or a sponsor for the project must be listed at the bottom of the abstract. Communications to the presenter regarding the abstract will be copied to the faculty co-author or sponsor.  In general, it is expected that most abstracts will list a faculty co-author.  In the case of a resident who may not have a faculty member as a co-author, the name of the residency program director (who is not necessarily a co-author) will suffice as long as contact information is provided.  If this process presents difficulties, please contact Program Co-Chair <a href="URL_FOR_CO-CHAIR_BIO" target="_blank"> CO-CHAIR_NAME</a> (<a href="mailto:CO-CHAIR_EMAIL_ADDRESS?cc=CO-CHAIR_ASSISTANT_EMAIL_ADDRESS">bdegenhardt@atsu.edu</a>), or <a href="URL_TO_OTHER_CO-CHAIR_BIO" target="_blank"> OTHER_CO-CHAIR_NAME</a> (<a href="mailto:OTHER_CO-CHAIR_EMAIL_ADDRESS?cc=CO-CHAIR_ASSISTANT_EMAIL_ADDRESS">OTHER_CO-CHAIR_EMAIL_ADDRESS</a>).</LI>
      <LI>The abstract must include 3-5 Keyword descriptors to help identify the research area. (As shown in the <a href="MODEL_ABSTRACT_URL" target="_blank">Model for the Abstract</a>). All Keywords must use lower case font unless they are proper nouns.</LI>
